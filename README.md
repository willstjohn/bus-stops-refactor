# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
The current project showcases a map of Boston and demonstrates several locations of stops for the MBTA bus. It includes some slight edits to the styling, resulting in a more muted and visually appealing look.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine and unzip the folder.
2. Create an account with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and retrieve your API key.
3. Paste your personal API key where prompted in `mapanimation.js`.
4. Open a new window in your browser and drag the `index.html` file onto it.
5. Press the button and watch the bus move along its route.

## Roadmap
In the future, I plan to make the marker and some UI elements a dark purple.
